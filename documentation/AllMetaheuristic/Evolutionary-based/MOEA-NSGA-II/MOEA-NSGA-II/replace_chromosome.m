function f  = replace_chromosome(intermediate_chromosome,pro,pop)
%% replace_chromosome(intermediate_chromosome,pro,pop)
% This function replaces the chromosomes based on rank and crowding
% distance. Initially until the population size is reached each front is
% added one by one until addition of a complete front which results in
% exceeding the population size. At this point the chromosomes in that
% front is added subsequently to the population based on crowding distance.
