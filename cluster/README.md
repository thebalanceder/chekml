 ## Algorithm overview and usage
 # 1. SelfEvolvingClustering
 - Description: Self-Evolving Clustering is an online clustering algorithm that incrementally updates cluster centroids based on incoming data points.
 - Parameters:
   - distance_threshold (float,default=1.0):Maximum distance to assign a point to an existing cluster. Larger values allow points to join clusters farther away.
   - learning_rate (float, default=0.1)
